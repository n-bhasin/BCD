            What is Lorem Ipsum?
                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
                specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in 
                the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including 
                versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                <p id="tile" class="answer"> <b>Answer:</b>
                    The position:absolute; help to position the element near to the parent positioned element.
                    for example: <br>
                    <div class="relative">This div element has position: relative;
                        <div class="absolute">This div element has position: absolute;</div>
                      </div>
                </p>

                <p class=question> <b>Question:</b>What does position relative do?</p>
                <p id="tile" class="answer"> <b>Answer:</b>
                    The position:relative; with this element gets the relative position and by using the top, bottom,left, right we can adjust it.
